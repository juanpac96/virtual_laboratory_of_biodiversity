# virtual_laboratory_of_biodiversity
Currently, the storage of data on biodiversity causes massive volumes of information that require efficient tools to be manipulated in order to generate new knowledge. The present study developed a virtual laboratory as a workspace for the management of biodiversity data framed in a research project in the colombian pacific through the articulation of a relational database in PostgreSQL, the JupyterHub ecosystem, the services of Amazon Web Services and global biodiversity data infrastructures. The laboratory allowed the collection of 28,058 records distributed in 6 projects between the years 2004 and 2022, with a total occurrence of 44 families, 119 genera and 198 species. Through the execution of work routines no longer than 11 minutes in programming code carried out by a group of researchers simultaneously from the internet browser, achieving greater accessibility, optimization and use of biodiversity data taking advantage of the elasticity and scalability offered. for the technologies discussed here.
